# Operator Runbook

## First run

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
pnpm typecheck
pnpm collect:price
pnpm collect:clmm-bundle
```

If `pnpm collect:clmm-bundle` fails, your clmm-v2 insight endpoint is not ready, `CLMM_DATA_API_BASE` is wrong, or `CLMM_INSIGHTS_API_KEY` is missing.

## Register OpenClaw jobs

```bash
pnpm cron:render
pnpm cron:sync -- --apply
openclaw cron list
```

### Migrating from legacy collector (first time only)

If you had the old `cron/jobs.yaml` registered, four legacy jobs may still be active:

```bash
openclaw cron remove --name clmm-daily-sol-usdc-insight
openclaw cron remove --name clmm-range-review
openclaw cron remove --name clmm-emergency-volatility-check
openclaw cron remove --name clmm-weekly-performance-review
```

These jobs reference deleted scripts (`pnpm collect:backend`, `pnpm insight:daily`, `pnpm review:range`) and will fail harmlessly but noisily until removed. Verify cleanup:

```bash
openclaw cron list
```

## Test a job

```bash
openclaw cron list
openclaw cron run <jobId>
openclaw cron runs --id <jobId> --limit 20
```

## Configuration & Credentials

Durable price telemetry collection requires the following credentials and environment variables to be configured in `.env` (configured via `.env.example` as a template):

- `PYTH_HERMES_BASE_URL`: Base URL for the Pyth Hermes API (defaults to `https://hermes.pyth.network`).
- `PYTH_API_KEY`: API Key for Pyth Hermes. Optional for local development/low-frequency runs, but required in production.
- `PYTH_SOL_USD_FEED_ID`: The price feed ID for SOL/USD (canonical feed ID `0xef0d8b6fda2ceba41da15d4095d1da392a0d2f8ed0c6c7bc0f4cfac8c280b56d`).
- `JUPITER_API_BASE`: Base URL for Jupiter's quote API (defaults to `https://api.jup.ag`).
- `JUPITER_API_KEY`: Optional Jupiter API Key for high-frequency or production rate-limit environments.

Ensure no actual credentials, keys, or authorization tokens are logged. The CLI automatically redacts headers and keys.

## Price Collector Exit Behavior

When running `pnpm collect:price` or `runPriceObservationsJob` via scheduling:

1. **Complete Success (Exit Code: 0)**: Both Pyth and Jupiter sources collected, normalized, and persisted successfully.
2. **Partial Success (Exit Code: 0)**: One of the sources (e.g. Jupiter quote) failed, but the other source (e.g. Pyth Hermes) succeeded, yielding at least one usable observation. The run outputs structured warnings to notify the operator.
3. **Conflict Failure (Exit Code: 1)**: Any database uniqueness or identity conflicts are detected (e.g., trying to write duplicate records for the same key with different payloads/hashes). The pipeline fails closed to protect data integrity.
4. **Total Failure (Exit Code: 1)**: Both sources failed to collect (e.g. internet down, both APIs timed out). No fresh observations are persisted.

## Pre-deployment Preflight Checks

Before deploying any schema migrations or running taxonomy updates, check if there are any historical `price_quote` rows in the database:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS price_quote_count
FROM intelligence.normalized_observations
WHERE observation_kind = 'price_quote';
```

> [!STOP]
> If `price_quote_count > 0`, abort deployment immediately. Check with the lead engineer regarding compatibility/migration policies. Do not rewrite history or overwrite kinds without approval.

## Failure modes

### Cron not firing

Check:

```bash
openclaw gateway status
openclaw cron status
openclaw cron list
```

### Cron fired but no message arrived

Check delivery config:

```bash
OPENCLAW_DELIVERY_CHANNEL
OPENCLAW_DELIVERY_TO
```

### Missing data

Correct behavior is conservative:

- hold
- watch
- pause_rebalances
- low confidence
- partial/stale data quality

If the agent invents missing data, tighten `AGENTS.md`, the routine prompt, or the relevant schema.

## Database Operations

### Run migrations

```bash
pnpm db:migrate
```

### Generate new migration (after schema changes)

```bash
pnpm db:generate
```

### Push schema to DB (dev only, no migration file)

```bash
pnpm db:push
```

### Verify DB connection

```bash
tsx -e "import { createDb } from './src/db/db.js'; const { db, client } = createDb(process.env.DATABASE_URL); await db.execute({ sql: 'SELECT 1' }); console.log('OK'); await client.end();"
```

## Observation Pipeline Diagnosis

All SQL queries below are read-only. Do not manually mutate immutable raw evidence.

### Malformed rejection (no raw row)

If a provider payload fails validation or structure parsing, no raw row is written. Check the collector log for network or payload schema errors. You can inspect recently fetched raw records:

```sql
SELECT received_at_unix_ms, source, parse_status, payload_hash
FROM intelligence.raw_observations
WHERE source IN ('pyth-hermes', 'jupiter-quote')
ORDER BY received_at_unix_ms DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Uniqueness Conflict (fail closed)

Source identity/hash collisions surface as conflicts. The pipeline fails closed — no normalized row is written:

```sql
-- Check for conflict status on raw or normalized observation boundaries
SELECT raw_observation_id, source, observation_kind, payload_hash, confidence_level
FROM intelligence.normalized_observations
WHERE payload_hash = $1;
```

### Failed/pending raw replay

A raw observation remains in `pending` if normalization failed, was interrupted, or didn't proceed:

```sql
-- Find pending raw observations that may need replay
SELECT observed_at_unix_ms, source, source_observation_key, parse_status
FROM intelligence.raw_observations
WHERE parse_status = 'pending'
ORDER BY observed_at_unix_ms DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Post-commit pending status

After a successful normalized commit, the raw row's `parse_status` should be updated to `parsed`. A raw row stuck in `pending` after its normalized counterpart is complete indicates a post-commit update failed:

```sql
-- Find raw rows stuck in pending after their normalized counterpart completed
SELECT r.observed_at_unix_ms, r.source, r.parse_status AS raw_parse_status,
       n.id AS normalized_id, n.is_stale
FROM intelligence.raw_observations r
JOIN intelligence.normalized_observations n ON n.raw_observation_id = r.id
WHERE r.parse_status = 'pending'
ORDER BY r.observed_at_unix_ms DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Freshness and Staleness Queries

Check the status of observations to see which are currently marked as stale or within their freshness validity windows:

```sql
-- Check for stale vs fresh observations by source and kind
SELECT source, observation_kind, is_stale, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM intelligence.normalized_observations
GROUP BY source, observation_kind, is_stale;

-- Retrieve fresh observations only
SELECT id, source, observation_kind, valid_until_unix_ms, received_at_unix_ms
FROM intelligence.normalized_observations
WHERE is_stale = false
ORDER BY received_at_unix_ms DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Latest-file repair

The compatibility artifact at `data/latest-price-snapshot.json` or `data/latest-clmm-bundle.json` may lag after a replay. Repair by re-running the collector:

```bash
pnpm collect:price
pnpm collect:clmm-bundle
```

The DB remains the source of authority; local JSON files are compatibility fallbacks only.

### Guaranteed connection close

All adapter operations use try/finally to ensure connections close even on error. If a connection leak is suspected:

```sql
-- Check for active backend queries/connections (requires pg_stat_activity view)
SELECT pid, state, query_start, query
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE datname = current_database()
  AND state = 'active'
  AND query LIKE '%intelligence.%';
```

### Diagnosing by source key

To find observations for a specific source key:

```sql
SELECT observed_at_unix_ms, source, source_observation_key, payload_hash, parse_status
FROM intelligence.raw_observations
WHERE source_observation_key = $1
ORDER BY observed_at_unix_ms DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Diagnosing by payload hash

To check for duplicate source content:

```sql
SELECT payload_hash, COUNT(*) AS cnt, MIN(observed_at_unix_ms) AS first_observed, MAX(observed_at_unix_ms) AS last_observed
FROM intelligence.raw_observations
GROUP BY payload_hash
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### Diagnosing by parse status

To get a count of observations by parse status:

```sql
SELECT parse_status, COUNT(*) AS cnt, MIN(observed_at_unix_ms), MAX(observed_at_unix_ms)
FROM intelligence.raw_observations
GROUP BY parse_status;
```
